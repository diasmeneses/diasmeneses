- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mariana Dias and I'm PhD student in Agronomy (Plant Production) ðŸŒ±
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automation, data sciences, and Python modeling with applications in agronomy. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working in two projects. The first one delves into the fusion of IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) to model the growth stages of microgreens within indoor cultivation environments. Simultaneously, I'm utilizing Esp32 technology to monitor beehives, aiming to fine-tune conditions for optimal propolis production.
